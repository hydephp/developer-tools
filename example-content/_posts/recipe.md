</p>

### About the recipe
- Servings: 4
- Time: 30 minutes

### Ingredients

* 250g or 9oz ground beef
* 250g or 9oz ground pork
* 1 egg
* 50 mL or 1/4 cup dried bread crumbs
* 200 - 300 mL or 3/4 - 1 1/4 cup(s) fluid, like water, milk or cream
* 1 small onion
* salt, pepper
* butter for frying

### Procedure

1.  Combine the liquid ingredients and the bread crumbs in a bowl and let it sit for 7-8 minutes.
2.  Finely chop or grate the onion.
3.  Combine the ground beef, ground pork, egg, chopped onion, salt and pepper in the bowl.
4.  Make round meatballs, approximately 2-3 centimeters (1 inch) in diameter.
5.  [Pan fry](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Saut%C3%A9ing "Cookbook:Sautéing") the meatballs on medium heat in a frying pan with butter for approximately 3-5 minutes. Fry them on all sides until they are brown and not pink in the middle. Shaking the pan occasionally will help the meatballs cook evenly.

### Serving

Serve them with [mashed potatoes](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Potato#Mashing "Cookbook:Potato") with a veal based brown sauce made with cream and lingonberry jam.
